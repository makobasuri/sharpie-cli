# Sharpie CLI

Just a small CLI-Tool, I thought was going to be useful, because I didn't find [Sharp-CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp-cli) fast enough. :)

CD into where your images are and execute commands -> all images inside will be output to ```cwd/sharpened```

### commands:

```
$ sharpie resize <width> [height]
```
If used with height, can crop your image
